# University-Decision-Making
The purpose of this project was to create an interactive Tableau dashboard utilizing the QS World 
University Rankings dataset to aid users in their university selection process. By incorporating 
calculated fields and parameters, the dashboard offers actionable insights based on research output, 
student-to-faculty ratio, and other relevant factors. The results include a user-friendly interface where 
users can explore and compare universities worldwide, narrowing down their choices by location and 
category. Through this project, I learned how to effectively leverage Tableau for data visualization, 
optimize datasets for visualization purposes, and derive actionable insights from complex datasets. 
The QS World University Rankings dataset, comprising information on 1500+ institutions, was 
preprocessed to remove irrelevant columns such as Logo and Website URL, streamlining the 
visualization process.
